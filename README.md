### Featured Projects

- **Aerodynamic Simulation** â€“ Developed a custom fluid mechanics tool to optimize aquatic propeller blades. Focused on maximizing thrust, minimizing drag, and ensuring structural integrity under high-stress conditions. Leveraged differential equations, advanced numerical root-finding methods, and Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory to model performance across varying flow regimes.

- **Pairs Trading with GARCH & Cointegration** â€“ Built a quantitative pairs trading strategy in Python, combining statistical finance and portfolio management: identified mean-reverting stock pairs using **cointegration**, forecasted short-term volatility with **GARCH**, and simulated trades including position sizing, realized/unrealized P&L, slippage, and commissions. Features **interactive visualizations** of spreads, z-scores, and predicted vs realized volatility, with **live data integration** through the Alpaca API. Built using **pandas, NumPy, statsmodels, arch, and Streamlit**.
